# Ouluweather

This is a really simple Go command-line application, that fetches current weather information from VTT weather station at http://weather.willab.fi/weather.html and displays it on command-line.

Example:

```
~ $ ouluweather
2015-09-21 00:17 EEST (60 seconds ago)
Oulu Linnanmaa temperature: +10.30C
```
